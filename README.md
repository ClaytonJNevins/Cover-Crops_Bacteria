Code for cover crop soil 16S rRNA gene sequencing study_Purdue_2016
Data submitted for publication in 2018. 
Data are 16S rRNA gene sequence data extracted from soil samples collected at the Purdue University Agriculture Center for Research and Education (ACRE) (2016). This repository contains the QIIME pipeline code used to group sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and to match the OTUs to existing taxa in the Greengenes database (version 13_8). Statistical code that was used to evaluate the resulting OTU tables in QIIME is also included. 
Sequences are deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information's GenBank (NCBI) Sequence Read Archize (SRA) under accession number SRP136448.
Questions can be directed to Clayton Nevins, University of Florida (nevinsc@ufl.edu).
